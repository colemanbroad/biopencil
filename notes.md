1. load an ISBI tiff
2. volume render it with perspective in OpenCL
3. display the result in an SDL window

fast and efficient volume renderning with rotation and color, takes a TIFF path as cmd line arg.

Parameterize view state by 3x3 rotation matrix and update it with arrow keys.
This is more powerful representation than the previous `view_angles:[2]f32` model
which required a view_angles â†’  rotation matrix transformation (`rotmatFromAngles()`), but we could update view_angles by 
simply adding a scalar value. 

- [x] use `setPixels()` for faster surface blitting.
- Q: how to draw only on sub rectangle?

- Refactor using `View` struct in zig and opencl.
- Got `max_project_float()` kernel execution down to 15ms.
- Note single pass on Cele volume to calculate min/max takes 60ms ?!?! That's so slow. But it does touch every pixel once.
- bugfix 3D `boxImage()`

# Questions

- when to use `@as` vs `@intCast`.

# Features

- [x] two rotation angles
- [ ] box around border
- [ ] clicking with fw/bw 3D map 
- [ ] dragging with cursor
- [ ] REPL interface with autocomplete to adjust params. access nested, internal structs. interactive.
- [ ] colors: smoother color pallete...


# Bugs

- [ ] The rendering uses `maxSteps=15` which causes severe aliasing from undersampled depth dimension, but increasing causes severse slowdown.
- [ ] Reading TIFF is slow. 95MB tiff file reads in 2s... Most of this must be decoding, because I can `dd` the file to `/dev/null/` at 4GB/s.
- [ ] OpenCL device & context creation is slow and highly variable. Between 60ms .. 450ms. Also I feel noticeable lag on my screen when working with most apps. This is a problem with my laptop's graphics hardware.
- [ ] `r.direc` needs rescaling by `view.anisotropy`. Use dot product?
- [ ] make depth coloring use colors of equal luminance! blue is much darker than yellow!
