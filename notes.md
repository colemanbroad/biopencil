## more interactive

- [x] two rotation angles
- [ ] box around border
- [ ] clicking with fw/bw 3D map 
- [ ] dragging with cursor
- [ ] text box that exposes dynamic parts of program and allow user costomization. has autocomplete.
        ideally the internal interface allows us to expose arbitrary (nested) structs and update them interactively via user.
- [ ] 

colors: smoother color pallete...
